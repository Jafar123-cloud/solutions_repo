# Task 1: Estimating Ï€ using Monte Carlo Method - Circle-Based Approach

## Explanation:

To estimate $\pi$ using Monte Carlo simulations, we can take advantage of the geometric properties of a circle inscribed inside a square. The idea is to generate random points within the square and determine how many of those points fall inside the circle.

Consider a unit circle, where the radius $r = 1$. The circle is inscribed in a square that has side length 2, so the area of the square is $A_{\text{square}} = 2 \times 2 = 4$, and the area of the circle is $A_{\text{circle}} = \pi \times r^2 = \pi$.

### Geometric Probability:

Let us randomly generate points $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are uniformly distributed between $-1$ and $1$. For a point to be inside the unit circle, the condition is:
$$ x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 $$

The ratio of the number of points inside the circle ($N_{\text{circle}}$) to the total number of points ($N_{\text{total}}$) will approximate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square:
$$ \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} \approx \frac{A_{\text{circle}}}{A_{\text{square}}} = \frac{\pi}{4} $$

Thus, we can estimate $\pi$ by rearranging the formula:
$$ \pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} $$

### Steps:
1. Generate random points $(x, y)$ in the square with coordinates between $-1$ and $1$.
2. Check if each point satisfies the condition $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ to determine if it lies inside the circle.
3. Calculate the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points and multiply by 4 to estimate $\pi$.

## Formula Summary:
$$ \pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} $$
