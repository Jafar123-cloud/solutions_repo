# Problem 2

# Task 1: Estimating π using Monte Carlo Method - Circle-Based Approach

## Explanation:

To estimate $\pi$ using Monte Carlo simulations, we can take advantage of the geometric properties of a circle inscribed inside a square. The idea is to generate random points within the square and determine how many of those points fall inside the circle.

Consider a unit circle, where the radius $r = 1$. The circle is inscribed in a square that has side length 2, so the area of the square is $A_{\text{square}} = 2 \times 2 = 4$, and the area of the circle is $A_{\text{circle}} = \pi \times r^2 = \pi$.

### Geometric Probability:

Let us randomly generate points $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are uniformly distributed between $-1$ and $1$. For a point to be inside the unit circle, the condition is:
$$ x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 $$

The ratio of the number of points inside the circle ($N_{\text{circle}}$) to the total number of points ($N_{\text{total}}$) will approximate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square:
$$ \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} \approx \frac{A_{\text{circle}}}{A_{\text{square}}} = \frac{\pi}{4} $$

Thus, we can estimate $\pi$ by rearranging the formula:
$$ \pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} $$

### Steps:
1. Generate random points $(x, y)$ in the square with coordinates between $-1$ and $1$.
2. Check if each point satisfies the condition $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ to determine if it lies inside the circle.
3. Calculate the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points and multiply by 4 to estimate $\pi$.

## Formula Summary:
$$ \pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} $$

# Task 2: Simulation - Estimating π through Monte Carlo Method

## Simulation:

In this task, we will simulate the estimation of $\pi$ by generating random points in a 2D square bounding a unit circle. We will count how many of these points fall inside the circle and use that ratio to estimate the value of $\pi$.

### Steps:
1. **Generate random points**: Create random points $(x, y)$ uniformly distributed within the square with coordinates between $-1$ and $1$ for both $x$ and $y$.
2. **Check if the point is inside the unit circle**: The condition for a point to be inside the unit circle is:
   $$ x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 $$  
   If the point satisfies this condition, it lies inside the circle.
3. **Estimate $\pi$**: The ratio of the points inside the circle to the total points will approximate the ratio of the areas of the circle and square:
   $$ \pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} $$

   Explanation of the Code:
Random Points: We generate num_points random points with $x$ and $y$ values uniformly distributed between $-1$ and $1$.

Check for Points Inside the Circle: We use the condition $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ to check if a point lies inside the unit circle.

Estimate π: We calculate the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points, and multiply by 4 to estimate $\pi$.

![alt text](image-5.png)

Explanation of the Plot:
Blue Points: These are the points that fall inside the unit circle.

Red Points: These are the points that fall outside the unit circle.

The plot visually demonstrates how the points are distributed within the square and the circle, illustrating the Monte Carlo method for estimating $\pi$.

# Task 3: Visualization - Plotting Randomly Generated Points

## Visualization:

In this task, we will visualize the results of the Monte Carlo simulation by plotting the randomly generated points. We will distinguish the points that fall inside the unit circle from those that fall outside, and display the plot.

![alt text](image-6.png)
Explanation of the Code:
Random Points: We generate random points $(x, y)$ within the square that has side lengths of 2, with both $x$ and $y$ values between $-1$ and $1$.

Inside the Circle: The condition $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ is used to check if the point lies inside the unit circle.

Plotting:

Blue Points: These are the points that lie inside the circle.

Red Points: These are the points that lie outside the circle.

The plot is set to have equal aspect ratio to properly show the circle, and a grid is added for clarity.

## Population Distributions

Select several types of population distributions, such as:

- Uniform distribution
- Exponential distribution
- Binomial distribution

For each distribution, generate a large dataset representing the population.

### Formulas:

1. **Uniform Distribution**:  
   The uniform distribution has the following probability density function (PDF):  
   $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}, \quad a \leq x \leq b $$  
   where $a$ and $b$ are the minimum and maximum values of the distribution, respectively.

2. **Exponential Distribution**:  
   The exponential distribution has the following PDF:  
   $$ f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0 $$  
   where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter, which is the inverse of the mean.

3. **Binomial Distribution**:  
   The binomial distribution has the following probability mass function (PMF):  
   $$ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$  
   where $n$ is the number of trials, $k$ is the number of successes, and $p$ is the probability of success in a single trial.

For each distribution, generate a large dataset by sampling from the population using appropriate functions in Python.

- **Sample Mean**: The sample mean is given by the formula:  
  $$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$  
  where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $n$ is the sample size, and $x_i$ are the individual sample points.

Repeat the process multiple times (e.g., 1000 iterations) to create a sampling distribution of the sample mean.

# Task 3: Parameter Exploration

## Investigating the Effect of Population Distribution and Sample Size

Explore how the shape of the original population distribution and the sample size influence the rate of convergence to normality.

### Key Considerations:
- **Population Distribution**: Investigate how different population distributions (Uniform, Exponential, Binomial) affect the convergence to normality in the sampling distribution.
- **Sample Size**: Observe how increasing the sample size impacts the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Larger sample sizes generally lead to a faster convergence to a normal distribution, according to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

### Formula for Variance of the Sampling Distribution:
The variance of the sample mean is given by:  
$$ \sigma_{\bar{x}}^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} $$  
where $\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2$ is the variance of the sample mean, $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the original population, and $n$ is the sample size.

### Impact of Population Variance:
- **Population Variance ($\sigma^2$)**: The spread of the sampling distribution is affected by the population's variance. A larger population variance results in a wider sampling distribution.
- **Sampling Distribution Variance**: As the sample size increases, the variance of the sampling distribution decreases (this is due to the $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ relationship).

### Visualization:
- Plot how the spread of the sampling distribution changes with varying population variances.
- Observe the rate at which the distribution approaches normality for different population shapes and sample sizes.

- **Sampling Distribution Variance**: As the sample size increases, the variance of the sampling distribution decreases (this is due to the $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ relationship).

### Visualization:
- **Step 1**: Generate histograms for different sample sizes (e.g., 5, 10, 30, 50) for each population distribution. 
- **Step 2**: For each sample size, repeat the sampling process 1000 times to build the sampling distribution of the sample mean.
- **Step 3**: Plot the histograms to observe the convergence to normality.
- **Step 4**: Compare how the population's variance affects the spread of the sampling distribution.
- **Step 5**: Use Python libraries such as Matplotlib to generate the histograms for each scenario.

Example of plotting histograms for different sample sizes:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters for the simulation
population_size = 10000
sample_sizes = [5, 10, 30, 50]
population = np.random.exponential(scale=1, size=population_size)  # Exponential distribution

# Function to calculate sample means
def generate_sample_means(population, sample_size, num_samples=1000):
    sample_means = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        sample = np.random.choice(population, size=sample_size, replace=False)
        sample_means.append(np.mean(sample))
    return sample_means

# Plot histograms for different sample sizes
for sample_size in sample_sizes:
    sample_means = generate_sample_means(population, sample_size)
    plt.hist(sample_means, bins=30, alpha=0.7, label=f'Sample Size = {sample_size}')

plt.title('Sampling Distribution of the Mean for Different Sample Sizes')
plt.xlabel('Sample Mean')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend()

In the above Python code:

We simulate an exponential population and generate sample means for different sample sizes (5, 10, 30, 50).

A histogram is plotted to visualize the convergence of the sample mean distribution to normality as the sample size increases.

# Task 4: Practical Applications

## Reflecting on the Importance of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that plays a crucial role in a variety of real-world applications. It allows us to make inferences about population parameters even when the population distribution is unknown. Below are some key areas where the CLT is used:

### 1. Estimating Population Parameters

In many real-world scenarios, it is impractical or impossible to measure an entire population. The CLT allows us to estimate population parameters, such as the mean and variance, using sample data. With the assumption that the sample size is sufficiently large, the sample mean will approximate the population mean, even if the population distribution is not normal.

- **Example**: A political polling company collects sample data from a small group of people to estimate the average opinion of a larger population. By the CLT, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution, making it easier to estimate the true population mean.

### 2. Quality Control in Manufacturing

The CLT is used extensively in quality control processes in manufacturing. It enables the use of sample data to monitor and maintain product quality by examining sample means. If the sample means follow a normal distribution, any significant deviation from the expected mean can indicate a potential issue in the manufacturing process.

- **Example**: In a factory that produces metal rods, the company measures the lengths of a small sample of rods at regular intervals. The CLT ensures that, as long as the sample size is large enough, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal. This helps detect defects or issues in the production line.

### 3. Predicting Outcomes in Financial Models

The CLT is a vital tool in financial modeling, particularly when predicting returns on investments or analyzing risk. Financial markets often exhibit complex, non-normal distributions. However, by using large samples, the CLT ensures that the sampling distribution of the sample mean of financial returns can be approximated as normal, making it easier to apply various statistical techniques like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

- **Example**: A financial analyst wants to estimate the average return of a stock portfolio over the past year. By sampling from historical return data and applying the CLT, the analyst can predict the mean return of the portfolio with greater confidence, even if the original distribution of returns is skewed or otherwise non-normal.

### Conclusion

The Central Limit Theorem plays an essential role in practical applications, allowing for more reliable decision-making and predictions, even when faced with imperfect or incomplete data. By ensuring that sample means tend to follow a

# Task 4: Practical Applications

## Formula:

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size increases, even if the population distribution is not normal.

The formula for the sampling distribution of the sample mean is:

$$ \mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu $$  
$$ \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$

Where:
- $\mu_{\bar{x}}$ is the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, which equals the population mean $\mu$.
- $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, which is the population standard deviation $\sigma$ divided by the square root of the sample size $n$.

One of the most elegant applications of Monte Carlo methods is estimating the value of  \pi through geometric probability. By randomly generating points and analyzing their positions relative to a geometric shape, we can approximate \pi in an intuitive and visually engaging way. 

This problem connects fundamental concepts of probability, geometry, and numerical computation. It also provides a gateway to understanding how randomness can be harnessed to solve complex problems in physics, finance, and computer science. The Monte Carlo approach to  \pi estimation highlights the versatility and simplicity of this method while offering practical insights into convergence rates and computational efficiency.

Consider a unit circle, where the radius $r = 1$. The circle is inscribed in a square that has side length 2, so the area of the square is $A_{\text{square}} = 2 \times 2 = 4$, and the area of the circle is $A_{\text{circle}} = \pi \times r^2 = \pi$.

### Geometric Probability:

Let us randomly generate points $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are uniformly distributed between $-1$ and $1$. For a point to be inside the unit circle, the condition is:
$$ x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 $$

The ratio of the number of points inside the circle ($N_{\text{circle}}$) to the total number of points ($N_{\text{total}}$) will approximate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square:
$$ \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} \approx \frac{A_{\text{circle}}}{A_{\text{square}}} = \frac{\pi}{4} $$

Thus, we can estimate $\pi$ by rearranging the formula:
$$ \pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} $$

### Steps:
1. Generate random points $(x, y)$ in the square with coordinates between $-1$ and $1$.
2. Check if each point satisfies the condition $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ to determine if it lies inside the circle.
3. Calculate the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points and multiply by 4 to estimate $\pi$.

## Formula Summary:
$$ \pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} $$

### Graphical Output:

The following Python code generates random points inside a square and plots them to visualize the points inside and outside the circle.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Number of random points
num_points = 1000

# Generate random points
x = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, num_points)
y = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, num_points)

# Check if points are inside the unit circle
inside_circle = x**2 + y**2 <= 1

# Plotting the points
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.scatter(x[inside_circle], y[inside_circle], color='blue', label='Points Inside Circle')
plt.scatter(x[~inside_circle], y[~inside_circle], color='red', label='Points Outside Circle')
plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')
plt.xlim(-1, 1)
plt.ylim(-1, 1)
plt.title('Monte Carlo Simulation for Estimating π')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
This code will generate a plot where:

Blue points are inside the unit circle.

# Task 2: Simulation - Estimating π through Monte Carlo Method

## Simulation:

In this task, we will simulate the estimation of $\pi$ by generating random points in a 2D square bounding a unit circle. We will count how many of these points fall inside the circle and use that ratio to estimate the value of $\pi$.

### Steps:
1. **Generate random points**: Create random points $(x, y)$ uniformly distributed within the square with coordinates between $-1$ and $1$ for both $x$ and $y$.
2. **Check if the point is inside the unit circle**: The condition for a point to be inside the unit circle is:
   $$ x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 $$  
   If the point satisfies this condition, it lies inside the circle.
3. **Estimate $\pi$**: The ratio of the points inside the circle to the total points will approximate the ratio of the areas of the circle and square:
   $$ \pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{circle}}}{N_{\text{total}}} $$

### Python Code for the Simulation:

```python
import numpy as np

# Number of random points
num_points = 10000

# Generate random points in the square [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]
x = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, num_points)
y = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, num_points)

# Count points inside the unit circle
inside_circle = x**2 + y**2 <= 1
N_circle = np.sum(inside_circle)
N_total = num_points

# Estimate pi using the ratio
pi_estimate = 4 * N_circle / N_total
print(f"Estimated value of π: {pi_estimate}")
Explanation of the Code:
Random Points: We generate num_points random points with $x$ and $y$ values uniformly distributed between $-1$ and $1$.

Check for Points Inside the Circle: We use the condition $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ to check if a point lies inside the unit circle.

Estimate π: We calculate the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points, and multiply by 4 to estimate $\pi$.

Graphical Output:
To visualize the random points and the unit circle, we can modify the code to display a plot showing the points inside and outside the circle:

python
Copy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plotting the points
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.scatter(x[inside_circle], y[inside_circle], color='blue', label='Points Inside Circle')
plt.scatter(x[~inside_circle], y[~inside_circle], color='red', label='Points Outside Circle')
plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')
plt.xlim(-1, 1)
plt.ylim(-1, 1)
plt.title('Monte Carlo Simulation for Estimating π')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
Explanation of the Plot:
Blue Points: These are the points that fall inside the unit circle.

Red Points: These are the points that fall outside the unit circle.

The plot visually demonstrates how the points are distributed within the square and the circle, illustrating the Monte Carlo method for estimating $\pi$.

# Task 3: Visualization - Plotting Randomly Generated Points

## Visualization:

In this task, we will visualize the results of the Monte Carlo simulation by plotting the randomly generated points. We will distinguish the points that fall inside the unit circle from those that fall outside, and display the plot.

### Python Code for Visualization:

# Number of random points
num_points = 10000

# Generate random points in the square [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]

y = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, num_points)

# Check if points are inside the unit circle
inside_circle = x**2 + y**2 <= 1

# Plotting the points
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))

# Points inside the circle (blue)
plt.scatter(x[inside_circle], y[inside_circle], color='blue', label='Points Inside Circle')

# Points outside the circle (red)
plt.scatter(x[~inside_circle], y[~inside_circle], color='red', label='Points Outside Circle')

# Adding details to the plot
plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')
plt.xlim(-1, 1)
plt.ylim(-1, 1)
plt.title('Monte Carlo Simulation for Estimating π')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
Explanation of the Code:
Random Points: We generate random points $(x, y)$ within the square that has side lengths of 2, with both $x$ and $y$ values between $-1$ and $1$.

Inside the Circle: The condition $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ is used to check if the point lies inside the unit circle.

Plotting:

Blue Points: These are the points that lie inside the circle.

Red Points: These are the points that lie outside the circle.

The plot is set to have equal aspect ratio to properly show the circle, and a grid is added for clarity.

Graphical Output:
The plot will display a square with randomly generated points:

Blue dots represent the points that are inside the unit circle.

Red dots represent the points that are outside the unit circle.

This visualization demonstrates the distribution of points and how they help estimate $\pi$ based on the ratio of points inside the circle.

Here's the fourth task in markdown format for Visual Studio Code, focusing on the analysis of the accuracy, convergence rate, and computational considerations of the Monte Carlo simulation:

# Task 4: Analysis - Convergence and Computational Efficiency

## Analysis:

In this task, we will analyze how the accuracy of the estimate for $\pi$ improves as the number of points in the simulation increases. We will also discuss the convergence rate and computational efficiency of the Monte Carlo method.

### Investigating the Accuracy:

As we increase the number of random points used in the Monte Carlo simulation, the estimated value of $\pi$ should converge to the true value. This is because the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points will better approximate the ratio of the areas of the circle and the square as the sample size increases.

We can plot the estimated value of $\pi$ for different sample sizes and observe how the estimate improves with more points.
