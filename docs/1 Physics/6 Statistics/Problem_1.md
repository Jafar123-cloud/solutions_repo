# Task 1: Simulating Sampling Distributions

## Population Distributions

Select several types of population distributions, such as:

- Uniform distribution
- Exponential distribution
- Binomial distribution

For each distribution, generate a large dataset representing the population.

### Formulas:

1. **Uniform Distribution**:  
   The uniform distribution has the following probability density function (PDF):  
   $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}, \quad a \leq x \leq b $$  
   where $a$ and $b$ are the minimum and maximum values of the distribution, respectively.

2. **Exponential Distribution**:  
   The exponential distribution has the following PDF:  
   $$ f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0 $$  
   where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter, which is the inverse of the mean.

3. **Binomial Distribution**:  
   The binomial distribution has the following probability mass function (PMF):  
   $$ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$  
   where $n$ is the number of trials, $k$ is the number of successes, and $p$ is the probability of success in a single trial.
