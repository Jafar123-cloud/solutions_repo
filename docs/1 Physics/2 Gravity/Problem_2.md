# Problem 2
# Task 1 : Defining the First, Second, and Third Cosmic Velocities

The concept of cosmic velocities refers to the minimum speeds needed for an object to achieve certain objectives in space: orbiting a celestial body, escaping its gravitational influence, and leaving a star system. These velocities are fundamental for space exploration and understanding how spacecraft interact with gravitational fields.

## 1. **First Cosmic Velocity: Orbital Velocity**

The first cosmic velocity is the minimum velocity an object must have to enter a stable orbit around a celestial body. This velocity ensures that the object moves fast enough such that its trajectory bends in a circle, counteracting the pull of gravity. 

The first cosmic velocity $v_1$ can be calculated using the formula:

$$ v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} $$

Where:
- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.67430 \times 10^{-11}$ m$^3$ kg$^{-1}$ s$^{-2}$),
- $M$ is the mass of the celestial body (e.g., Earth, the Moon),
- $r$ is the distance from the center of the celestial body to the object (orbital radius).

This velocity represents the speed required to stay in a circular orbit without falling back to the surface of the celestial body.

## 2. **Second Cosmic Velocity: Escape Velocity**

The second cosmic velocity is the speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational influence of a celestial body without any further propulsion. This is the minimum velocity required to overcome the gravitational potential energy of the body and reach an infinite distance from it.

The second cosmic velocity $v_2$ is given by:

$$ v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}} $$

Where:
- $G$ is the gravitational constant,
- $M$ is the mass of the celestial body,
- $r$ is the distance from the center of the celestial body to the object.

This velocity is exactly $\sqrt{2}$ times the orbital velocity, and it's required for an object to break free from the celestial body's gravitational pull.

## 3. **Third Cosmic Velocity: Solar Escape Velocity**

The third cosmic velocity is the speed needed to escape the gravitational pull of the Sun (or any star) and leave the solar system. This is the velocity at which an object must travel to escape the gravitational influence of the entire star system.

The third cosmic velocity $v_3$ is calculated using the formula:

$$ v_3 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{\text{sun}}}{r_{\text{sun}}}} $$

Where:
- $G$ is the gravitational constant,
- $M_{\text{sun}}$ is the mass of the Sun,
- $r_{\text{sun}}$ is the distance from the object to the Sun.

In practical terms, the third cosmic velocity is extremely high and typically requires interplanetary travel technology to achieve, often involving multiple stages of propulsion.
