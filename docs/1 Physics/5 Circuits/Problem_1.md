## Algorithm for Calculating the Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

The algorithm to calculate the equivalent resistance of a circuit using graph theory simplifies the circuit by identifying and reducing series and parallel connections iteratively. The goal is to reduce the graph until a single equivalent resistance is obtained. 

### Steps for the Algorithm:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Represent the circuit as a graph, where nodes (vertices) are junctions, and edges represent resistors with weights equal to their resistance values.

2. **Series and Parallel Connection Identification**:
   - **Series Connection**: If two resistors are connected end-to-end (series), their resistances simply add up:
   
   $$
   R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2
   $$

   - **Parallel Connection**: If two resistors are connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance is given by: 
   
   $$
   \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
   $$

3. **Iterative Simplification**:
   - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or another traversal method to detect series and parallel combinations.
   - Once identified, replace the detected series or parallel components with their equivalent resistance.
   - Update the graph by removing the old components and adding the new equivalent resistance as a single edge.

4. **Handling Nested Combinations**:
   - After each simplification step, check the resulting graph for further series or parallel combinations.
   - Repeat the process until the graph is reduced to a single equivalent resistance.

### Example Circuit Representation

Let's assume we have the following circuit with resistors:

- $R_1 = 10 \ \Omega$
- $R_2 = 20 \ \Omega$
- $R_3 = 30 \ \Omega$
- $R_4 = 40 \ \Omega$

This circuit is represented as a graph where each node is a junction, and each edge is a resistor with a given resistance value.
